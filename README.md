# Drug Name Prediction Using Embedding Methods

This repository contains an innovative approach for predicting drug names using embedding methods on both Persian and English languages. The models used in this project are FastText and BERT.

The dataset used in this study is sourced from DrugBank, a comprehensive resource that provides detailed drug data. Prior to the application of the embedding methods, the dataset underwent a preprocessing phase to ensure optimal results. This included steps such as cleaning, normalization, and tokenization.

The combination of these advanced techniques and meticulous data preparation has been used in drug name prediction, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in advancing healthcare and pharmaceutical research.
